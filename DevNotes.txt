Development Structure
---------------------

The source folder structure is required by the solution & projects to be like
this:-

+-WMICmd
+-Lib
| +-Core
| +-WCL
| +-WMI
+-Scripts

The following commands will create that structure by cloning the various
application and library repositories:-

C:\> mkdir Win32
C:\> git clone https://github.com/chrisoldwood/WMICmd.git Win32\WMICmd
C:\> mkdir Win32\Lib
C:\> git clone https://github.com/chrisoldwood/Core.git Win32\Lib\Core
C:\> git clone https://github.com/chrisoldwood/WCL.git Win32\Lib\WCL
C:\> git clone https://github.com/chrisoldwood/WMI.git Win32\Lib\WMI
<optional>
C:\> git clone https://github.com/chrisoldwood/Scripts.git Win32\Scripts

Command Line Builds
-------------------

Included in the scripts folder is one for building via the command line:-

C:\> Win32\Scripts\SetVars vc90
C:\> Win32\Scripts\Build debug Win32\WMICmd\WMICmd.sln

There is also one for upgrading to a later version of Visual C++:-

C:\> Win32\Scripts\SetVars vc140
C:\> Win32\Scripts\Upgrade Win32\WMICmd\WMICmd.sln

Tests
-----

A separate project exists in the solution with unit tests:-

> WMICmd\Test\Debug\%VC_PLATFORM%\Test.exe

There is also a script that runs a few smoke tests too:-

> WMICmd\TestScript debug
